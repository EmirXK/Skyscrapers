**A simple yet challenging GUI puzzle game made with Java.**

## About the Game

Skyscrapers is a logic puzzle game where you place skyscrapers of varying heights on a 4x4 grid. The challenge lies in meeting the conditions set by the numbers on the edges of the grid. These numbers represent how many skyscrapers a person standing at that position would be able to see.

Can you solve the puzzle and ensure that all conditions are met?

## How to Play
